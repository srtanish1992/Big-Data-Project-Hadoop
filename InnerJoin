Although I interviewed three experts for this important assignment, I hired Krista because she took time to get to know me, my industry, and my potential.  It is important for her to do the job right.  She has the keen sense to ask the right questions.  She is a valuable resource who shared gold nuggets of information that are still yielding fruit.  I would recommend her to my family and good friends, and anyone who wanted to gain the competitive edge of being at the head of the pack.  Two thumbs way up!",0,-05qMWbhAtrD6EiV-UElPg,0,5,3/24/2012,review,2

Girls dancing in a giant tub of milk, struggling vocal artists just waiting for the moment to try and steal the show, and a D list celebrity! What more could anyone ask for?  Actually, it wasn't the worst, but I am sure glad we didn't pay for tickets.  The best part was with Timber.  That, in itself, earned it the third star for me.  Perhaps our experience was because Holly was out this week.  But from other reviews, it seems as if that wouldn't have made much of a difference.",0,-0Ackw6MF82PXO9f9Jh_Kg,1,3,1/28/2011,review,1

I'm sure dancing topless was their aim to distract viewers from noticing the sub par dancing. Holly never speaks a word, and this black chick and white dude do all the singin and talking.  For 113 the view would be pretty good, but for 85 the view is hardly worth going for.  Still 113 for dancing tits is debatable. I couldn't  understand why everyone was so pumped to see this show, and even more so when holly showed her boobs, or someone did something sexy.  sorry fake boobs and small b cups just didn't impress me.  save your money go see La Reve at the wynn.. amazing just like the wynn ;)",0,-0Ackw6MF82PXO9f9Jh_Kg,0,2,8/11/2010,review,0

I was weary at first because of the bad reviews, but I had such a good time. My friends and I were laughing throughout the show. It's definitely a treat for both men and women. Our guy friends thought it would be a femmie show, but it's so sexy! Topless girls splashing in milk, pole dancing, and riding a pony swing blindfolded? Awesome. I felt that the show had the same intentions as Cirque's Zumanity, but Peepshow is wayy better! Music is fun too! They take a twist on music we all know and love. Yes, Holly Madison, was a huge disappointment, but whatevs, she's still cool in my book. We got tix at the Coke bottle tiks booth that morning for $55 each and they weren't bad at all. Still in the mezzanine and in perfect view of everything for a lot cheaper than what it normally goes for. I'd definitely watch it again.",0,-0Ackw6MF82PXO9f9Jh_Kg,0,4,7/28/2010,review,0

I have been to many Vegas shows and I have to say...I cannot figure out why this one is STILL running!  No...I know!  Everyone wants to see Holly's boobs!  Well...you have to wait almost the whole show for that and if you can make it that long thru this train wreck of a show, you are a better person than me.  Don't get me wrong...there are a few good parts...The main guy in the show has an AMAZING voice!  Some of the pole work was VERY impressive.  But the show itself is absolutely ridiculous!  I thought there would be a point to show, but apparently there isn't.  The milk bath grossed me out.  The routines were ridiculous, I have one friend that leaned over during the show and said, ""I don't get it...did that car just burn off her clothes?"", yes, it's that ridiculous!  What does a car have to do with Little Bo Peep anyway?!   I didn't go into this with high expectations, and my expectations were not met AT ALL.  Apparently word has spread that the show sucks, because the theatre wasn't even 1/2 full.  I say skip this and see another Cirque, and I'm not a huge fan of those either (I feel like if you've seen one, you've seen most of them!), but I'd much rather have gone to LOVE or Viva Elvis.",0,-0Ackw6MF82PXO9f9Jh_Kg,0,2,6/18/2010,review,0

First, the seats are REALLY, REALLY uncomfortable (unless you are a twig). I felt bad because there was this BIG dude and he had to sit on top of the chairs. Secondly, there are poles by where you have to get into your seat so it was hard to even get to the seat. Now the show iteslf, yes there are topless girls, but the whole thing was kinda hokey and not very sexy. Holly was on for like 5 minutes and they guys that were supposedly supposed to be the girls love interests were clearly gay and not really believable. It really wasn't anything special and I feel bad for the people who paid full price. Also, if you wanted to meet Holly after the show it was $100. What a money hungry (you fill in the rest). She should want to meet her fans and I really lost respect for her after that. Don't waste your time or money on this one.",2,-0Ackw6MF82PXO9f9Jh_Kg,1,2,8/30/2009,review,4
